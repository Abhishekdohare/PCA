# PCA Analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. If there are n observations with p variables, then the number of distinct principal components is min ( n âˆ’ 1 , p ). This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest
