# PCA Analysis

Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure for reduction of dimensions in a data set that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components

## How to use

1. Download the code in the zip format from "Clone or Download" button above
2. Decompress the file on the desktop
3. Open the file “PCAplot.Rproj” from extracted folder named "PCA-master" in RStudio
4. Source the code in the script of RStudio
5. Call the main function ” PCA_Plot” by providing the gene data file path and the meta data file path as arguments in the PCA_Plot function and press enter
